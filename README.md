# ordered-cache
Implementation of several cache data structures that maintain ordering on the key. In particular, Move-to-root tree (introduced by [Allen and Munro](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/322092.322094)) and Attach-and-splay tree are the main components of a paper I co-authored ([not available yet]()). The purpose of this program is to evaluate the performance of ordered cache data structures.

| Name | Codename | Restructuring Heuristic | Leaf Queue
| - | - | - | - |
| Splay Tree | ```st``` | promote to the root with double rotations | yes
| Light Splay Tree | ```lst``` | promote to the root with double rotations | no
| Attach-and-splay Tree | ```ast``` | single rotation then promote to the root with double rotations | yes
| Move-to-root Tree | ```mtr``` | promote to the root with single rotations | yes
| Simple Exchange Tree | ```se``` | one single rotation | yes

An LRU cache is also implemented (Codename ```lru```) and a fixed cache (Codename ```fc```) where the container is untouched once it is full.

# Compilation

Evaluate a data structure:
```g++ -std=c++2a orderd-cache/*.cpp -o ocds -O3```

Compute statistics of a stream:
```g++ -std=c++2a dataset-analysis/main.cpp -o dsa -O3```

# Dataset
The input stream must be of the following format (one key per line):
```
<string>
<string>
<string>
...
<string>
```
# Execution

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| ```<path>``` | string | path the dataset folder (must end with "/") |
| ```<dataset>```| string | filename of the dataset (must be inside ```<path>```) |
| ```<n>``` | int | maximum number of key stored |
| ```<model>``` | string |  codename of the model |
| ```<ranking>``` | ```0``` or ```1``` | ```1``` to activate tracking mode |
| ```<prefix>``` | ```0``` or ```1``` | ```1``` to activate the prefix queries |
| ```<prefix_offset>``` | int | optional: offset of the end of the prefix |

### Evaluate a data structure
```./ocds <path> <dataset> <n> <model> <tracking> <prefix> <prefix_offset> ```

### Compute statistics of a stream
```./dsa <path> <dataset>```

# Output
### Evaluate a data structure
#### Without tracking mode activated
There is one line

```<dataset> <model> <n> <size (bytes)> <hit rate> <latency (us)> <cache hit latency (us)> <avg. prefix hits> <prefix latency (us)>```

#### With tracking mode activated
There are two lines

```<dataset> <model> <n> rank <array of 101 integers>```

```<dataset> <model> <n> leafset <array of 501 integers>```

The first line display an array R such that R[i] is the number of time the distinct age of the deleted node is (i $\pm$ 0.5)% of n.
The second line display an array L such that L[i] is the number of time the size of the leaf queue is (i $\pm$ 0.5)â€° of n.


### Compute statistics of a stream
There is one line

```<dataset> <number of distinct keys> <number of keys> <avg. key size>```
